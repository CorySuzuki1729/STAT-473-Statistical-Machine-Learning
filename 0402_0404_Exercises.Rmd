Exercise 1
```{r}
library(randomForest)
p = ncol(train) - 1
set.seed(1)
bag.mod = randomForest(high_sales ~., data = train_car, mtry = p, importance = TRUE)

varImpPlot(bag.mod, main = "Variable Importance of Bagging Model")

##The most important predictor based on the Gini index is the price predictor.

yhat.bag = predict(bag.mod, test_car, type = "class")
